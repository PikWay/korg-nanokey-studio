# Mapping files for nanoKey Studio in Reason

Description:
All knobs are configured (in each scene) 
Only one "Sustain" button (in Scene 1) is configured


Installation:

nanoKEYStudio.remotemap -> 
ex. C:\ProgramData\Propellerhead Software\Remote\Maps\Korg

nanoKEYStudio.lua and nanoKEYStudio.luacodec nanoKEYStudio.png -> 
ex. C:\ProgramData\Propellerhead Software\Remote\Codecs\Lua Codecs\Korg

Autodetect is not working. 

Only minimal mapping is done (Keyboard, Malstorm, SubTractor, OctoREX). Please check remotemap file for details. 
Feel free to modify or addapt to your needs. 

This is based on not modified controller setup (default) - if you've changed anything in Korg Controll Editor - it might not work.
